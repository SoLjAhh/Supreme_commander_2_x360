# Supreme_commander_2_x360
Lua scripts for xbox version of Supreme Commander 2
Most if not all of the scripts will be compatible with PC version

Main goal is to figure out how to uncompile "toc.x360.bdf" and then recompile the file.
this file is responsible for what .scd's and bp/lua files get loaded for xbox. PC version does not 
suffer from this issue.

while it is possible to manually edit the lua files, the problem for the 360 version is that some of the key 
functions that would allow for easier modding are somewhat blocked in a sense that code can be added, but not files or .scd's.

WHAT HAS BEEN DONE:
* Scale Mod
* AI Enhancement Mod
* 1.25 PC version Nueral net data (Compiled version for speedup)
* Re-worked weapons and units stats
* UEF RockHead Tanks are now amphibious, similar to TA's tanks.(maybe should make this a research option)
* Re-Worked economy of mass extractors and power generators.
